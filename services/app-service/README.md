# Applications Service

The applications service is responsible for monitoring and managing all mission
applications for a system.

The service is capable of tracking multiple versions of each application, allowing
users to easily upgrade and rollback their mission applications when necessary.

More information about the applications service architecture and how to use it can
be found in our [official documentation](https://docs.cubeos-doc-websitem/latest/ecosystem/services/app-service.html)
