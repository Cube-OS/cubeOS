# ISIS Antenna Systems Service

CubeOS Service for interacting with an [ISIS Antenna System](https://www.isispace.nl/product-category/products/antenna-systems/)

# Configuration

The service must be configured in `/etc/cubeos-config.toml` with the following fields:

- `[isis-ants-service.addr]`

    - `ip` - Specifies the service's IP address
    - `port` - Specifies the port on which the service will be listening for UDP packets

- `[isis-ants-service]`

    - `bus` - Specifies the I2C bus the antenna system is connected to
    - `primary` - Specifies the I2C address of the antenna system's primary microcontroller
    - `secondary` - Specifies the I2C address of the secondary microcontroller. If no secondary contoller is present, this value should be `"0x00"`.
    - `antennas` - Specifies the number of antennas present in the system. Expected value: 2 or 4.
    - `wd_timeout` - Specifies the interval at which the AntS watchdog should be automatically kicked. To disable automatic kicking, this value should be `0`.

For example:

```toml
[isis-ants-service.addr]
ip = "0.0.0.0"
port = 8110

[isis-ants-service]
bus = "/dev/i2c-0"
primary = "0x31"
secondary = "0x32"
antennas = 4
wd_timeout = 10
```

# Starting the Service

The service should be started automatically by its init script, but may also be started manually:

```bash
$ isis-ants-service
CubeOS antenna systems service started
Listening on: 0.0.0.0:8110
```

If no config file is specified, then the service will look at `/etc/cubeos-config.toml`.
An alternative config file may be specified on the command line at run time:

```bash
$ isis-ants-service -c config.toml
```

## Test Results

Get the test results of the last run test

Note: For this service, this actually just fetches the nominal
and debug telemetry of the system, since there is no actual
built-in test

```json
{
    testResults{
        success,
        telemetryNominal{...},
        telemetryDebug{...}
    }
}
```

## System Armed Status

Get the current armed/disarmed status of the system

```json

```json
{
    deploymentStatus {
        status: DeploymentStatus,
        sysBurnActive: Boolean,
        sysIgnoreDeploy: Boolean,
        sysArmed: Boolean,
