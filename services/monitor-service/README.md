# Monitor Service

Service for monitoring CubeOS processes, memory, and CPU usage

# Running the Service

The service should be started automatically by its init script, but may also be started manually:

```bash
$ monitor-service
Listening on: 127.0.0.1:8089
```

If no config file is specified, then the service will look at `/etc/cubeos-config.toml`.
An alternative config file may be specified on the command line at run time:

```bash
$ monitor-service -c config.toml
```
