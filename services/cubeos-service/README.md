# Rust Service Library

This crate simplifies the process of creating a CubeOS Service in Rust.

The basic use of the crate is through the `Service` structure.

This structure provides an interface for creating a new service instance,
configuring it with a hardware subsystem and Juniper Query/Mutation objects.

It also provides a starting entry point and basic configuration file parsing.

More information about developing services can be found in our
[service development guide](https://docs.cubeos-doc-websitem/latest/ecosystem/services/service-dev.html).

# Use

The basic use of the cubeos_service crate is through the Service structure.
This structure provides an interface for creating a new service instance,
configuring it with a hardware subsystem and Juniper Query/Mutation objects.
It also provides a starting entry point and basic configuration file parsing.

## In Services

Services should only link to the `cubeos_service` crate if they have a
hardware device they want to expose over the service interface (currently GraphQL/HTTP).

## Configuration

Services which use this crate have the option of using a local configuration file
or falling back on default config values. The service will search for the configuration
file at this location `/etc/cubeos-config.toml` unless otherwise specified with
the `-c` flag at run time.

The service configuration file uses the Toml format and is expected to use the
following layout:

```toml,ignore
[service-name]
config-key = "value"
config-key2 = 123

# This section and values are needed for all services
[service-name.addr]
ip = "127.0.0.1"
port = 8082
```

The `[service-name.addr]` section is required for all services and is used to set
the ip/port on which the service will listen for messages. Any service specific
configuration values can be specified directly under the `[service-name]` section.
Note - the `service-name` used in the sections must match the name used when creating
the `Config` instance inside your service.

### Examples

# Creating and starting a simple service.

```rust,ignore
use cubeos_service::{Config, Service};
use model::Subsystem;
use schema::{MutationRoot, QueryRoot};

Service::new(
    Config::new("service-name").unwrap(),
    Subsystem::new(),
    QueryRoot,
    MutationRoot,
).start();
```

# Using the service config info to configure the subsystem.

```rust,ignore
use cubeos_service::{Config, Service};
use model::Subsystem;
use schema::{MutationRoot, QueryRoot};

let config = Config::new("example-service").unwrap();
let subsystem = Subsystem { bus = config["bus"] ) };
Service::new(
    config,
    subsystem,
    query,
    mutation
).start();
```

# Running a service with the default config file (`/etc/cubeos-config.toml`).

```bash
$ ./example-service
```

# Running a service with a custom config file.

```bash
$ ./example-service -c config.toml
```
