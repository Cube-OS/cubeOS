# CubeOS File Transfer Service

The file transfer service is used to transfer files between the mission operations
center and the OBC.
It may also be used to transfer files between a developerâ€™s system and the OBC when
in a development environment.

More information about the file transfer service architecture and how to use it can
be found in our [official documentation](https://docs.cubeos-doc-websitem/latest/ecosystem/services/file.html)
