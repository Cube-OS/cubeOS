CubeOS

=========

CubeOS is an open-source software stack for satellites forked from the orignal found at https://github.com/kubos/kubos.

The CubeOS system is designed to take care of every aspect of a satelliteâ€™s flight
software.

Rather than operating as a single, monolithic entity, CubeOS is comprised of a series
of independent, yet interoperating components.

- Mission applications control and execute the logic necessary to accomplish mission goals
- Services expose hardware and system functionality with a controlled and uniform interface
- CubeOS Linux provides the base operating system and the drivers needed to communicate with connected hardware devices
