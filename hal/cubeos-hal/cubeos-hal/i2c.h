 * @brief Configures and enables an I2C bus
 *
 * This function is used to configure and enable I2C buses for further usage
(reading/writing).
 * It is always the first required step before using any I2C peripheral. The
k_i2c_init function
 * takes an I2C device name and a pointer to where the returned file
descriptor
 * should be stored
 * After correctly calling k_i2c_init, the returned file descriptor may be
used with
 * the k_i2c_read/k_i2c_write/k_i2c_terminate functions.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * @code
int bus = 0;
k_i2c_init("/dev/i2c-1", &bus);
 * @endcode
 *
 * @param device I2C device name to initialize
 * @param fp Pointer to storage for file descriptor of I2C bus
