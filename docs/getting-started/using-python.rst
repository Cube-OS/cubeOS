Getting Started with CubeOS and Python
=====================================

This document will cover getting started using Python for local CubeOS development.

Good news! If you have installed the build dependencies listed in :ref:`build-dependencies`
then you are ready to start developing in Python!

It is important to note that CubeOS Linux runs Python3.7. It is strongly advised
that any local testing is done with this version to ensure compatibility.

You will also want to ensure that the ``app-api`` Python library has been installed
locally. If you have not already installed it, then follow these steps::

    $ git clone https://github.com/cubeos/cubeos
    $ cd cubeos/apis/app-api/python
    $ pip3 install .

Great! If you have followed all of these steps then you should have all necessary
Python dependencies installed!
