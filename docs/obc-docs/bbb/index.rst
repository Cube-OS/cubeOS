Debug Console Connection
------------------------

As documented in section 7.5 of the :title:`Beaglebone Black System
Reference Manual`, an FTDI cable can be connected to the serial debug
connector in order to establish a debug console connection.

This connection will be passed through to a CubeOS Vagrant image as
`/dev/FTDI`.

Ethernet Connection
-------------------

Please refer to our :ref:`ethernet overview <ethernet>` for help setting up an SSH connection over
ethernet.

Peripherals
-----------

By default, CubeOS exposes the following peripheral components:

- Ethernet
- 2 I2C buses
- 1 SPI bus
- 5 UART buses
- 7 ADC pins
- Many GPIO pins

More information about these peripheral devices can be found in the :doc:`working-with-the-bbb` doc.
