Compiling Code for a Target OBC
===============================

In order for programs written using a compiled language (Rust, C, etc) to work on a target OBC,
they will need to be compiled using the appropriate cross-compile toolchain.

This document covers the process of installing the cross-compile toolchain and compiling a program
for a target OBC using a local development environment.

The CubeOS SDK comes with the cross-compile toolchains pre-installed, as well as some additional
helper tooling.
If you are using the SDK as your development environment, please refer to :doc:`those docs <../sdk-docs/index>`
for more specific information.

.. note::

    The toolchains have been generated and tested with a Linux-based host operating system.
    There may be issues when using them with a Mac-based operating system. If so, please use the
    :doc:`SDK <../sdk-docs/index>` in order to cross-compile your projectes instead.

Download
--------

Below are the direct download links for the latest cross-compiling toolchains.
These toolchains contain the majority of utilities required to build a CubeOS project.
They include things like the C and C++ compilers and linkers which are needed to generate
executables for the target architecture, as well as tools which the host will use to assemble and
package other OS components.
If you need a prior version of a toolchain, please contact a CubeOS team member for support.

Installation
------------

Uncompress the toolchain into your location of choice.
We recommend that you choose a location which is outside of your system path, since the toolchains
may contain binaries which have duplicate names to those which already exist in the system.

Rust
~~~~

If you are programming in Rust, you will now want to `configure Cargo <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html>`__
to use the new toolchain.

Navigate to your ``.cargo`` directory and edit the ``config`` file (or create one if it doesn't
already exist)

Add a new ``[target.*]`` section with a ``linker`` variable which points to the toolchain's ``gcc``
file::

    [target.$triple]
    linker = "/path/to/{obc}_toolchain/usr/bin/{arch}-gcc"
    
Please refer to the CubeOS SDK's `Cargo config file <https://github.com/cubeos/cubeos-vagrant/blob/master/cubeos-dev/bin/cargo_config>`__
for reference.
You should be able to directly copy the lines pertaining to your target OBC.

Using the Toolchains
--------------------

Rust
~~~~

The new toolchains can be used by specifying the previously-defined target triple in the
``--target`` argument when running ``cargo build``.

For example::

    $ cargo build --target arm-unknown-linux-gnueabihf
    
More specific information about how to set up and use a Rust project can be found in the
:doc:`../getting-started/using-rust` doc.

C
^

To use the toolchains with C, define the ``CC`` and ``CXX`` envars with the path to the appropriate
binary prior to compiling your code.

For example::

    $ export CC=/home/user/bbb_toolchain/usr/bin/arm-linux-gcc
    $ export CXX=/home/user/bbb_toolchain/usr/bin/arm-linux-g++
    $ cmake .. && make

More specific information about how to set up and use a C project can be found in the
:doc:`../sdk-docs/sdk-c` doc.
