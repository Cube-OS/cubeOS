Upgrading CubeOS Linux
=====================

Overview
--------

CubeOS Linux upgrades are distributed as `kpack-{YYYY.MM.DD}.itb` files.
ITB stands for 'Image Tree Blob' and allows CubeOS to utilize the
existing DFU utility currently available in U-Boot.

Within each file will be a new version of the kernel image and root
filesystem.

To upgrade a board currently running CubeOS Linux, an upgrade package
should be loaded into the upgrade partition of the board.
For now, this is done by manually copying the package into the upgrade
partition and then setting the ``cubeos_updatefile`` environment variable.

Once the board is rebooted, U-Boot will take the package and then
install each component into the appropriate partition (kernel/rootfs).
If installation completes successfully, then the board will be rebooted
and then boot into the new version of CubeOS Linux.

The overall flow looks like this:

   CubeOS Linux Upgrade

.. note::

    User files should not be impacted by upgrade installation as long as
    they remain under the /home directory. This directory maps to the
    user space partition.
    
    However, some future releases may cause the CubeOS libraries to undergo
    significant changes. In this case, backwards compatilibity is not
    guaranteed and user applications may need to be rebuilt.

.. _upgrade-installation:

Upgrade Installation
--------------------

Pre-Requisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The host computer should be connected to the target board, which should
be on and running CubeOS Linux.

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Contact a CubeOS team member for an upgrade file for your desired CubeOS Linux version.
Alternatively, create one yourself following the directions in the :ref:`upgrade creation <upgrade-creation>`
section.

.. note::

    Not all releases can be installed via upgrade. Some releases contain
    changes which massively alter the system, causing a full install to be
    required instead.


Transfer the package to the target system using ``scp`` or other :ref:`file transfer <file-transfer>`
method of choice::

   $ scp kpack-{version}.itb cubeos@{target_ip}:/upgrade/

Once the transfer has completed successfully, log into the board and set the ``cubeos_updatefile``
variable with the name of the upgrade file like so::

    $ fw_setenv cubeos_updatefile kpack-{version}.itb

Now, trigger a reboot of the board. This can be done with the Linux ``reboot`` command.

When the board boots into U-Boot, the new package will be detected and
loaded. If the loading is successful, the board will reboot into the
newly installed CubeOS Linux. The U-Boot console messages will look
similar to this:

::

    Processing upgrade 'kernel@1' :crc32+ sha1+ 
    ###writing kernel

.. _upgrade-rollback:

Upgrade Rollback
----------------

If for some reason you need to rollback to a previous version of CubeOS
Linux, you don't need to reflash the board with the correct upgrade
package. Previous packages are not deleted once they have been loaded.
As a result, you can simply specify which package you would like to boot
into and then restart your system.

From the CubeOS Linux shell:

::

    $ fw_setenv cubeos_updatefile kpack-{desired version}.itb
    $ reboot

.. _upgrade-creation:

Upgrade Creation
----------------

This section is for developers who have made changes to CubeOS Linux and
want to generate an upgrade package.

Pre-Requisite
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Build the new OS.
Refer to the appropriate :ref:`Building CubeOS Linux for the {OBC} <custom-klb>` instructions.

Run the Packaging Script
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

From the 'cubeos-linux-build/tools' folder, run the ``cubeos-package.sh``
script.
This takes the `rootfs.img` and `cubeos-kernel.itb` files which were created during the build
process and uses the `kpack.its` file to bundle them into an `\*.itb` file.
This is the file that will be distributed to customers when an upgrade is needed.

The automatically generated naming convention for the package is
kpack-*yyyy*-*mm*-*dd*.itb

Custom Files
^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you'd like to customize the upgrade file, there are a few different
options available through the script:

-  -t {target} : **Required** Specifies the name of the target board,
   as named in the corresponding `cubeos-linux-build/board/cubeos/{target}`
   directory.
-  -i : Sets the name and location of the input `\*.its` file. Use if you
   want to create a custom package. The default is *kpack.its*.
-  -o {folder} : Specifies the name of the buildroot output folder. The
   default is 'output'
-  -v : Sets the version information for the package. The output file
   will be `kpack-{version}.itb`.
-  -b {branch} : Specifies the branch/version name of U-Boot that has been
   built. The default is '1.1'. This option should not need to be
   used outside of development. U-Boot contains files which are used in
   the package generation process.

For example:

::

    $ ./cubeos-package.sh -t beaglebone-black -i /home/test/custom.its -v 2.0
    
.. todo::

    Distribute the Package
    #~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
    There isn't currently a central storage location or procedure for upgrade packages.
    This section should be upgraded once something has been implemented.
