FAQs
----

How do I contact y'all?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Our community Slack: `slack.cubeos-doc-website <https://slack.cubeos-doc-website>`__

Our email: info@kubos.co

How do I set up the CubeOS SDK?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

See :doc:`sdk-docs/sdk-installing`

How do I check if I'm using the latest version of the CubeOS Vagrant image?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

From your host machine, issue the ``vagrant box outdated`` command.

How do I get the latest version of the CubeOS Vagrant image?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

From your host machine, issue the ``vagrant box update`` command.

.. warning:: This will overwrite all files in your existing image


How do I see the debug output of my board?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``minicom cubeos``

How do I check what version of CubeOS Linux I'm running?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Issue the ``uname -r`` command on the target board to display the kernel information.
The CubeOS Linux version will be the *n.n.n* number after "CubeOS".

::

    uname -r
    4.4.23-CubeOS-1.0.0

What's the default CubeOS Linux login?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

cubeos/CubeOS123

How do I make Rust binaries smaller?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:ref:`Check out our Rust optimization tips <rust-opt>` for suggestions on how to make your compiled
Rust projects smaller.

Updating my local Rust installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We keep the CubeOS repo locked to specific Rust version. When this version changes
you will need to update your local Rust version. You can do so by looking at the Rust version
that CubeOS is locked to (`found here <https://github.com/cubeos/cubeos/blob/master/rust-toolchain>`__)
and using that version number in the following commands.

Updating the native Rust toolchain::

    $ rustup toolchain install 1.xx.y-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu

Updating the Rust cross compiler targets::

    $ rustup target add armv5te-unknown-linux-gnueabi --toolchain 1.xx.y
    $ rustup target add arm-unknown-linux-gnueabihf --toolchain 1.xx.y


Troubleshooting
---------------

CubeOS SDK
~~~~~~~~~

The ``vagrant up`` command just hangs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you're using Windows 7 SP1, make sure you are using the :ref:`correct version of
Windows PowerShell <powershell>`.

I've tried other steps here, but my CubeOS Vagrant image is still behaving weirdly.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Try logging out and restarting the VM using the ``vagrant reload`` command.

I can't build my project. I keep getting "Permission denied" errors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you copied your project from another location, it's possible that the files are set up with root permissions
only. Change the project file permissions to allow the local ``vagrant`` user to have access.

::

    sudo chown vagrant:vagrant . -R

Interacting with an OBC
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Can't Connect via Serial Debug
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the SDK was unable to connect to the CubeOS Linux target using ``minicom cubeos``:

-  Check that the CubeOS Linux target is turned on and connected to your computer

-  Check that no other Vagrant images are running. Only one VM can have
   control of the USB, so it may be that another instance currently has
   control of the device. You can shutdown a Vagrant image with the
   command ``vagrant halt``

-  Verify that the USB is showing up within the Vagrant environment with
   the ``lsusb`` command. You should see an FTDI device

-  Verify that the USB has been mapped to a linux device. Issue the
   command ``ls /dev``. You should see a /dev/ttyUSB\* device. If you
   don't, try rebooting your Vagrant image (``vagrant halt``,
   ``vagrant up``)

Can't Connect via SSH
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Log in to the board via the debug UART and verify the IP address matches what is expected with ``ipaddr``.

For more information, check out our documentation about :ref:`ethernet connections <ethernet>`.

System Won't Boot into Linux
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the system goes through the :doc:`full recovery process <ecosystem/linux-docs/cubeos-linux-recovery>` and the bootcount is still exceeded,
it will present the U-Boot CLI instead of attempting to boot into CubeOS Linux again.

If this occurs, follow the :ref:`instructions for resetting the boot environment <env-reset>`.

Note: This is a case which normal users should never encounter, but becomes more likely when initially testing
custom CubeOS Linux builds.

The OBC is Booting from the eMMC Instead of the microSD when Upgrading
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you see errors, or the OBC seems to be booting from the eMMC instead of the microSD, make sure your microSD is being read correctly by running ``ls mcc 0:1`` at the U-Boot prompt. You should see the boot partition files listed (kernel, {board}.dtb, etc). If you are presented with errors, check that the microSD card is seated properly in the SD card slot.

I transferred a script, but it won't run
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``scp`` does not preserve file modes by default, however ``scp -p`` should preserve
the execute bit. Check that your file has the appropriate execute permissions turned on.
